## Abstract
In this project, you should build a Multisig Wallet Smart Contract. A multisig wallet is a wallet where multiple "signatures" or approvals are needed for an outgoing transfer to take place. As an example, I could create a multisig wallet with me and my 2 friends. I configure the wallet such that it requires at least 2 of us to sign any transfer before it is valid. Anyone can deposit funds into this wallet. But as soon as we want to spend funds, it requires 2/3 approvals.  


Here are the requirements of the smart contract wallet you will be building  

- Anyone should be able to deposit ether into the smart contract  

- The contract creator should be able to input (1): the addresses of the owners and (2):  the numbers of approvals required for a transfer, in the constructor. For example, input 3 addresses and set the approval limit to 2. 

- Anyone of the owners should be able to create a transfer request. The creator of the transfer request will specify what amount and to what address the transfer will be made.

- Owners should be able to approve transfer requests.

- When a transfer request has the required approvals, the transfer should be sent.
